### Base Structure

For every request you make to my endpoint whether the request is successful or not, you would always get a structure like this

```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "status": "OK",
  "message": "Message from my endpoint",
  "data": {}
}
```

The message can be an error message or a success message, then the data would be populated for every successful request.

### Base URL

`https://localhost:2800/api/video`

### Endpoint actions

`Upload`, `GetAll` `GetById`, `Delete`

### Upload Endpoint

The upload endpoint takes another parameter which is `/upload` just for clarity.

**Upload Endpoint URL**`https://localhost:2800/api/video/upload`

The API endpoint expects a video file and a title property in the **Request Body**

```json
{
  "title": "Writing Unit Tests In NodeJS Recording"
}
```

and then a file which is the recorded video.

#### Success Response

If the request succeeds, the API would return the following.

```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "status": "OK",
  "message": "Video upload successful",
  "data": {
    "title": "Writing Unit Tests In NodeJS Recording",
    "transcript": "So, in the last section, you learned how to write unit tests. Unit tests are easy to write, they're fast to execute, and they're ideal for testing functions with zero or minimal dependency to external resources. But in real world applications, we need to work with one or more external resources. That's where integration tests come into the picture. With integration tests, we test our application code along with these external resources as a whole. So, to write integration tests, we need a real database. We populate this database with data for testing. Now, we send an HTTP request to an endpoint we want to test, and then make an assertion. That assertion may involve inspecting the response or the database. For example, if we send an HTTP POST request to create a new genre, in an integration test, we're going to look at our database and verify that this new genre is there. So that's the big picture. In the next lecture, we're going to make a few simple tweaks to our application and prepare it for integration testing.",

  }
}
```

### Get All Videos Endpoint

The getAllVideos endpoint gets all the videos in the database, this is great if you want to display all the videos a user has recorded in the user's dashboard.

**Request URL**
`http://localhost:2800/api/video/`

**Example**
`localhost:2800/api/video/`

#### Success Response

If the request succeeds, the API would return the following.

```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "status": "OK",
  "message": "Videos fetched successfully",
  "data": [

That's one test case Assuming that the client is logged in. What is the next thing we need to check for? We want to make sure that customer ID is provided and if not, we want to return a bad request So you should return 400 if customer ID is not provided Similarly we want to make sure that movie ID is provided as well. So It should return 400 if movie ID is not provided It is possible that the client sends both the customer ID and movie ID, but we don't have a rental for this combination Then we want to return 404 or not found if no rental Found for this customer and movie What is the next possibility that we do have a rental but that rental is already processed in other words The customer already returned the movie in that case. We want to return 400 which means this is a bad request So return 400 if rental already processed So These are all the negative cases Now, let's take a look at positive cases if we get to this point, that means we're processing a valid return so we should return 200 if This is a valid request We should also set the return date. So set the return date Next we need to calculate the rental fee. So calculate The rental fee We should also add the movie back to the stock so increase the stock and Finally, what should we return to the client in the body of the response? We can return the summary of the rental so return the rental So this is the rental with all the properties set date out date returned rental fee and so on So these are the initial test cases that I can think of over the next few lectures We're going to implement each of these test cases one by one",

**Request URL**
`http://localhost:2800/api/video/:id`

**Example**
`localhost:2800/api/video/65199a1e19426728c0ab89a3`

#### Success Response

If the request succeeds, the API would return the following.

```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "status": "OK",
  "message": "Video fetched successfully",
  "data": {
    "_id": "65199a1e19426728c0ab89a3",
    "title": "Test cases in TTD",
